# TicTacToe Game

A simple TicTacToe game built using React.

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of the TicTacToe game. It allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The game will declare a winner when one player has three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. If no player achieves this and the grid is filled, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Interactive Board**: Click on squares to place 'X' or 'O'.
- **Status Display**: Displays the current player's turn and game result (winner or draw).
- **Reset Functionality**: Reset the game board to start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Used for building the UI components and managing state.
- **CSS**: Styling of the game board and components.
